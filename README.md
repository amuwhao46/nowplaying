Developing a dynamic waveform that follows the flow of the current song playing. The waveform and orbs move along with the beat of the current song being played on spotify.

I made another repository [here](https://github.com/amuwhao46/spotify-react). Where I followed a youtube video demoing react, spotify and various other libraries to make the experience easier. Based on What I've learned there, I will implement those ideas.

I have a better understanding on authorizing the code flow method for spotifies api. and also making use of a server to handle the responses and requests for different api calls.

Here is an image preview I made in Figma. This is how I expect the final result to look like

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
